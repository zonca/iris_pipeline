The Liger-IRIS Data Reduction System is based on the suite of packages from Space Telescope Science Institute
used to process data from JWST and NGRST.

With ``stpipe`` and ``stdatamodels`` we can configure each step of a pipeline through one or more text based .INI style files,
then we provide one input FITS file or a set of multiple inputs defined in JSON (named `Associations <https://jwst-pipeline.readthedocs.io/en/latest/jwst/associations/overview.html>`_).
Custom analysis steps and pipelines for IRIS are defined as classes in the current repository ``liger_iris_pipeline``

Then execute the pipeline from the command line using the ``tmtrun`` executable or using
directly the Python library.

The pipeline also dynamically interfaces to the ``CRDS`` the Calibration References Data System,
to retrieve the best calibration datasets given the metadata in the headers of the input FITS files.
The ``CRDS`` client can also load data from a local cache, so for now we do not have a actual
``CRDS`` server and we only rely on a local cache.

The ``CRDS`` is not under our control, the Thirty Meter Telescope will deliver a database system
to replace the ``CRDS`` and we can adapt our code to that in the future.
