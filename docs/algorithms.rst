Algorithms
==========

Algorithms to be implemented for the IRIS imager and Integral Field
Spectrograph. Once the actual classes are implemented in
:py:mod:`iris_pipeline`, we will just link their implementations.

Generate master dark
--------------------

The master dark is generated by the median of 5-10 individual dark
frames taken at the same exposure. This removes any of the
frame-to-frame noise variation. Individual dark frames are zero
illumination calibration frames with a shutter or blocking filter to not
allow any light to hit the detector.

::

   # 4096x4096 at 100 seconds exposures, N-frames
   # dark1, dark2, dark3, …, darkN
   darks = np.array([dark1, dark2, dark3, darkN])
   master_dark = np.median(darks, axis=0)

Dark subtraction
----------------

Each science and calibration frame will have dark current, residual
electric current that is flowing through the array when there is no
light. Dark current increases with time, so all science and calibration
frames need equivalent exposure dark frames. To remove the dark current,
we subtract a single dark in the real-time or a master dark in the final
pipeline, at the same exposure time as the science and calibration
frames.

::

   dark_subtracted_science = science - dark
   dark_subtracted_flat = flat - dark

Remove detector artifacts
-------------------------

The detector will have two types of artifacts; permanent/semi-permanent
and transient artifacts. Dead pixels, hot pixels or “frozen” pixel fall
with the permanent/semi-permanent artifacts while cosmic rays (CR) are
within the transient artifacts. Dead pixel are pixels that no longer
function. Hot pixels are sensitive pixels that can have a non-linear
response to incoming photons. They can also turn on and off and can even
respond normally until a certain flux is achieved in which they become
non-linear. “Frozen” pixels are pixels that have a low response rate
(opposite of the hot pixels), with similar types of problems. CRs are
high energy photons from the sky that can hit the detector randomly and
leave bright artifacts.

For all types of detector artifacts, they are generally difficult to
remove or remove completely with flat-fielding. To deal with detector
artifacts, they need to be either masked out or subtracted off. For
permanent artifacts, a bad pixel mask is used to mask the frame. Bad
pixel masks need to be throughout the lifetime of the detector. Over
time more pixels may become dead, hot or frozen. In some cases, hot or
frozen pixels might be able to be recovered, depending on their
severity. Hot, dead or frozen pixels, can be found by taking various
length N number of dark exposures and median combining them, if features
are 10-20 sigma above and below the noise level, they will be clipped
added to the masked. Since the pixel-to-pixel response will change, we
may apply a set of flat-fielding before clipping. CRs on the other hand
need to be removed from the frame. There are several methods for
removing CRs such as L.A. Cosmic (Dokkem et al. 2001) which takes the
Laplacian to find artifacts with steep slopes in individual frames. In
the most severe cases it is possible find cosmic rays by taking a median
of several science and calibration frames. In order to properly mitigate
CRs in the median case, one needs 3 or more frames in multiples of odd
numbers (i.e. 3, 5, 7…).

Flat Fielding
-------------

The response of individual pixels may vary significantly pixel-to-pixel.
In order to correct for this in the imager and the IFS slicer, it is
necessary illuminate the detector with a uniform light source. This can
be accomplished by an internal flat field, twilight flats or science
fields with a sparse number of sources. Internal flat fields are usually
provided by the calibration unit, in this case the NSCU. Twilight flats
are flats in which the telescope points to an area of the sky, while
tracking, and dithering around while taking exposures. Science fields
with sparse number of sources can be also used for flat fields, as long
as only few bright sources need to be masked out and the there is a
large enough dither such that every pixel will be on blank sky at some
point. The exposures for all cases need be before the detectors become
non-linear but with enough signal to illuminate each pixel, this is
typically 10000-20000 counts for a Hawaii-2RG. The flats are processed
by the normalize flats algorithm . Science frames are then divided by
the normalized flats. Sources detected in sky flats or science flats
will be masked out.

Scaled sky-subtraction
----------------------

Imager: Science images can as be used sky in sparse or medium density
fields (density compared to the dither size). In high density fields or
a source that fills the detectors, a separate sky will be needed. The
sky background will be estimated by measuring the median of each
detector. For the real-time pipeline the median of the sky background
will be subtracted off. The F-DRP will include an advanced algorithm
that iteratively determines the sky background and subtracts it off
following the procedure outlined in Clement et al. 2012;

1. Subtract median from each image (detector)

   -  Account for gain and sky, apply 5 sigma rejection (i.e. MAD)
   -  Keep track of the values subtracted

2. For each individual median subtracted image:

   -  Run SExtractor to detect all objects in frame and generate an
      object mask.

      -  Save “-object” check image

3. Compute the median of each pixel using the mask computed previously
   but not including the pixel from the image you are working on
4. Add background value from (3) to the median computed in (1), this
   will be the new sky background
5. Subtract the new background from original image

The iterative process would include the mosaicking algorithm which would
be the following

1. Stack final images
2. Redetect sources
3. Mask sources

This process would repeat until no more additional sources are detected
for masking.

IFS: The sky-subtraction algorithm will scale the sky frame to match
each of the individual science frames, utilizing the Davies et al. 2007
methodology. Various OH lines arise from families of vibrational
transitions. While sky lines can vary randomly throughout the night,
these families fluctuate together. Using brighter sky lines, comparing
the science and sky data cubes it is possible to determine the ratio
between OH lines for each transition family. These ratios can be applied
to the sky data cube in order to minimize the residuals in the
subtracted cube. The scaling ratios are applied to the entire sky data
cube, rather than to an extracted spectrum, such that any spatial or
wavelength variations in the sky lines across the cube will still be
accurately matched and cancelled out in the sky subtraction.

Flux calibration
----------------

| Imager: To convert from DN to flux (erg/s/cm^2/Hz) or AB magnitude a
  standard star needs to be observed in the same instrument
  configuration, airmass, and close in time as the science observations.
| For science fields and filters that overlap with SDSS (citation),
  Pan-STARRS (citation) or UKIDDS (citation) will be able to use the
  stars within the science frame for as standards (2MASS may be too
  bright and low resolution to use). For science fields outside these
  surveys or for more precise photometry will require observing a
  standard star from a standard field. Apertures of increasing radii
  will be used to determine the curve of growth and the appropriate
  aperture to use with the PSF and seeing, maximizing S/N. Once an
  aperture size is determined, the flux is integrated the flux for a
  given band to produce the flux of the star in DN. Aperture corrections
  will be applied based PSF and the seeing. For relative photometry,
  :math:`m_1-m_2=-2.5log_{10}\left(i \dfrac{f_1}{f_2}\right)`, where m1 and m2 are
  magnitudes of the sources and f1 and f1 are fluxes of the sources.
  This can be performed with a single source or the entire field with
  known sources to scale image. The zeropoints of the image can be
  determined from the known sources integrated flux and magnitude, (i.e.
  :math:`m=-2.5log_{10}\left( \dfrac{DN}{exptime}\right)+zeropoint`). On sky tests
  will be required to determine the extinction corrected instrumental
  zeropoints. IFS: To convert from DN to flux units (erg/s/cm^2/Ang) a
  standard star needs to be observed in the same instrument
  configuration, airmass,and close in time as the science observations.
  In the near-IR the standard star at minimum needs to have zJHK
  photometry or ideally a spectrophotometric standard (in which a
  calibrated spectrum already exists). For a standard star with zJHK
  photometry, the photometry will be fit with a Planck law (or
  Rayleigh-Jeans approximation :math:`1/\lambda^4`). Apertures of
  increasing radii will be used to determine the curve of growth and the
  appropriate aperture to use with the PSF and seeing. Once an aperture
  size is determined, the flux is integrated for a given wavelength to
  produce the spectrum of the standard star in DN. Aperture corrections
  based on the with growth curve and imager data. The science data cube
  and standard data cube are normalized by the exposure time such that
  they are each DN/s (count rate).
| For the standard, we take the ratio of the flux (ergs/s/cm^2/Ang) over
  the count rate (DN/s). Each spaxel in the science data cube is
  multiplied by the ratio (flux/count rate) from the standard
  :math:`F_{sci}=\dfrac{F_{std}}{R_{std}}*R_{sci}` , where F is flux
  (erg/s/cm^2) and R is count rate (DN/s)

Mosaic/Combine SCI
------------------

Imager: Mosaicking in the imager will be based on the dither pattern
selected, and integer and non-integer pixel shifts will be supported.
The dithers will be stored in the FITS header keywords and there will be
support for an external file with the offsets. For integer pixel shits,
frames will be combined using the median or mean, with sigma clipping to
clip out deviant pixels. The clipping options will include using the
standard deviation or median absolute deviation (MAD). For non-integer
pixel shifts, there are widely used efficient software packages that
handle drizzling and resampling, such as SWarp and DrizzlePac
(previously known as AstroDrizzle).[j]

IFS: Mosaicking in the IFS will be relative to a source or the dither
keywords in the FITS headers at a fixed PA. There will also be an option
to stack the images based on an external offsets file. Currently, only
integer pixel shifts will be supported. Frames will be combined using
the median or mean, with sigma clipping to clip out deviant pixels. The
clipping options will include using the standard deviation or median
absolute deviation (MAD).

Imager Algorithms
=================

Field distortion correction
---------------------------

The field distortion correction will correct the distortion in the
imager field due to the optics of the system. These distortions can be
chromatic and may need to be corrected per band. A calibration file with
the distortion solution will be used using the distortion solution
algorithm . The final image will need to be rectified and resampled
based on the distortion solution. Software already exists to perform
this task such as, SWarp, for rectifying and resampling the image based
on the new distortion solution.

IFS Algorithms
==============

Spectral extraction
-------------------

Lenslet: Flux from an individual lenslet will be spread out into
neighboring lenslets. Depending on the spacing between the lenslets,
will determine how much flux falls into a neighboring lenslet. In order
to recover the flux for an individual lenslet, it will be necessary to
perform a deconvolution on the entire lenslet array, assigning flux to
the appropriate lenslet. OSIRIS uses the Gauss-Seidel method to
iteratively assign flux to individual spatial pixels (spaxels; Krabbe et
al. 2004). The biggest assumption of the method is the knowledge of the
PSF. In order to mitigate this problem, the PSF needs to be mapped in 2D
and the structure of each lenslets PSF needs to be known precisely.
Thus, the spectral extraction requires additional calibration files,
rectification matrix (rectmat), which contains information about each
lenslets PSF as a function of wavelength. Additional methods may be
needed during INT. Slicer: Spectral extraction of the slicer will be
similar to MOS (multi-object spectroscopy). The trace of each spectrum
will be performed, typically fitting a low order polynomial. An aperture
will be used over the spectrum, optimizing signal-to-noise (Horne
1986?). The extraction will be highly dependent on the extraction region
and sky-subtraction algorithms .

Wavelength calibration
----------------------

Wavelength calibration is performed using on arc lamps taken during
daytime calibrations, typically Ar, Kr, and Xe. The arc lamps provide
better velocity resolution and stability over OH skylines. A global
wavelength solution is found for all of the spectra by fitting a low
order polynomial. Legendre polynomials are preferred as they can be
inverted (i.e. wavelength(pixel) → pixel(wavelength)) without
significant errors in the coefficients. Using the global solution, a
solution is found for each spaxel (spatial pixel). The solutions will be
resampled to a common linear wavelength scale. These solutions are found
be fairly stable in OSIRIS and we expect them to be similar. We
anticipate checking the solution monthly for any changes. The solutions
will be static based on the input lamp spectra and date they were taken.

Cube assembly
-------------

The spectral data cubes are assembled in this algorithm. The algorithm
takes each extracted spectrum from spectral extraction routine and maps
them to an x, y position on the sky (spatial rectification) based on the
WCS information, and their z positions are shifted based on their
individual wavelength solutions. The data cube format is (x, y,
wavelength), which is common among data cubes with wavelength and
frequency (i.e. VLT/SINFONI, ALMA and VLA).

Residual ADC
------------

If necessary, implement residual ADC module (TBD). The ADC corrects the
for the refraction caused by the atmosphere, at varying airmasses (or
elevation). If the residuals from ADC correction are significant (like
4th order), it may be necessary to implement a module. To calibrate it,
on-sky tests are required. One such test is to use a star to map the
dispersion through the system at varying airmasses. Once the system is
calibrated, temperature and pressure from the local weather, dome,
telescope and instrument can be incorporated into the correction of the
residuals per wavelength of light. With temperature/pressure lookup
table, the DRS will have the correct spectral trace for the extraction.
See instrument dispersion for how this is dealt with internally.

Telluric correction
-------------------

Telluric absorption is caused by the Earths atmosphere, in which all
spectra are attenuated by it. In order to correct for it, typically a
featureless star is used to measure the attenuation carefully and apply
a correction to the science spectra. Telluric correction as outlined by
Vacca et al. 2003:

1. Normalization of the observed A-type main sequence star spectrum
   (e.g. O, B, and A should be fine with “featureless” spectra, as well
   as white dwarfs) in the vicinity of a suitable absorption feature (as
   defined below);
2. Determination of the radial velocity shift of the A-type star;
3. Shifting the Vega model spectrum to the radial velocity of the A-type
   star;
4. Scaling and reddening the Vega model spectrum to match the observed
   magnitudes of the A-type star;
5. Construction of a convolution kernel from a small region around an
   absorption feature in the normalized observed A-type and model Vega
   spectra;
6. Convolution of the kernel with the shifted, scaled, and reddened
   model of Vega;
7. Scaling the equivalent widths of the various H lines to match those
   of the observed A-type star.

Finally, the convolved model is divided by the observed A-type spectrum
and the resulting telluric correction spectrum is multiplied by the
observed target spectrum.

Advanced Algorithms
===================

Optimizing readouts
-------------------

All of the algorithms used with ROP-DRS, including the various sampling
techniques (i.e UTR, MCDS), will be available offline for an end user
that wants extra control of optimizing the readouts of their science.
For example, a user may want to include readouts with a specific seeing
constraint (i.e. removing poor seeing frames).

PSF-reconstruction
------------------

Knowledge of the PSF is essential in the reduction of AO data. However,
this is challenging because of changing conditions (seeing) and the rate
at which they change as well as the structure of the PSF. In order to
reconstruct the PSF for a given observation, a simulated PSF from the
NFIRAOS PSF simulator will be used to do the deconvolution on the imager
and IFS. Laurent Jolissaint et al. 2011 (AO4ELT 2011)

Calibration algorithms
======================

Rectmats
--------

IFS lenslets: Rectmat (or rectification matrix) is a calibration file
used for the spectral extraction of the IFS lenslet data for a specific
scale and filter. An individual rectmat contains information about each
lenslets PSF as a function of wavelength. The rectmats are constructed
from spectral white light scans, which scan each individual lenslet to
determine their PSF and contribution to neighboring lensiets. This
information can also be used to remove the variation from
lenslet-to-lenslet, similar to a flat field.

Distortion solution
-------------------

The distortion solution algorithm will determine the distortion of the
image on the imager. It will be constructed by using a static uniform
grid pinholes (pinhole mask) and on sky calibration using dense stellar
field (i.e. globular cluster). The distortion solution will be
determined by fitting some type of nth order 2D polynomial (surface) to
the position of the pinholes. Software already exists to perform these
tasks such as; (1) SExtractor, for detecting the sources and (2) SCAMP,
for determining the distortion.

Super sky
---------

Super sky frames are median combined sky frames. The purpose of
combining them is increase the signal-to-noise of the sky. The super sky
frames are used for scaled sky subtraction of the imager (in the case
where the source fills the imager) and the IFS slicer.

Super dark
----------

See generate master dark

Instrumental dispersion
-----------------------

The optics of IRIS (including from NFIRAOS) can cause spectral
curvature, or instrumental chromatic dispersion. A white light fiber can
be used to map the dispersion (x and y position of the spectra) in the
system. In OSIRIS, most of the instrumental dispersion was caused by the
dichroic used in the AO system.

Normalize flats
---------------

Imager: The normalize flats algorithm takes the imaging flats and
generates a normalized flat (values 1 or close to one) which are used to
correct the pixel-to-pixel variation. To normalize the imaging flats, N
number of flats are median combined, subtracted by a dark (real-time) or
master dark (F-DRP) and then divided by either the median or mode
(depending on the distribution of pixel values on the detector) of the
combined flats.

::

   normalize_flat = (np.median(flat) - dark)/np.median(flat)

IFS slicer: The normalize flats algorithm takes the spectral flats and
generates a normalized flat (values 1 or close to one) which are used to
correct the pixel-to-pixel variation. The spectral flats median combined
and subtracted by a dark (real-time) or master dark (F-DRP). To
normalize the spectral flats, the spectral response is fit with a
polynomial and subtracted off each flat, and then divided by either
their median or mode (depending on the distribution of pixel values on
the detector).
